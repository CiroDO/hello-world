# hello-world
My name is Ciro, I'm from Brazil, born in 1996, and I started programming when I was 18, during my bacharelor in electronic engineering.
From this time to here, I've learnt some languages, like C and C++, and by myself Java, C#, Python, R, and superficially, JavaScript, PHP, CSS, and so on..
As you will see, my passion is C (I like some low level stuff), many of my projects are made in this language. But I'm trying to do some programs in C++ and C# too, to improve my habilities in these languages.
I find programming a powerful tool because we can do almost anything with it. And this excites me a lot, because sometimes I look to something and think.. "why don't I try to code this right now?", and I do it for fun, and this brings me a lot of knowledge and satisfaction. This drives me, even if a program exists, I want to do it for myself too.
When i was a kid, I aways wanted to be something like a hacker or a game developer. I had a little contact with programming before college, but aways had a feeling like, that's it, I want to do this, and here I am.
What I'm trying to do right now is learn C good enought to join a kernel development, or something else. Well, it takes some time to achieve such proeficiency, but I hope to write some drivers soon enought C:
